My brain was fuzzy and slow during this challenge; I probably could have achieved a much better time at peak coffee time. I also hereby predict that I will reuse the code from today in several challenges hence.

Today's challenge was a to implement a simple-purpose computer, which has instructions which can do nothing, move the pointer, or adjust the value of a single variable! Incredible new technology from sun microsystems. Part 1 was to detect infinite loops and complain about it. Part 2 was to fix them, by changing a single instruction (and then not complain about it). It was fun! Reminds me a lot of the intcode computer from last year. 


The code was pretty prosaic, and I'm tired, so no exegesis tonight. Gonna go see if I have any little umbrellas anywhere. [Here's the code, if you like that sort of thing.](https://github.com/natedileas/advent-of-code/blob/main/2020/day8.py)

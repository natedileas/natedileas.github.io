<p>Finished in 6:14!! This was a easy and fun set of puzzles. </p>

It reads: &quot;As your flight approaches the regional airport where you'll switch to a much larger plane, customs declaration forms are distributed to the passengers.

The form asks a series of 26 yes-or-no questions marked a through z. All you need to do is identify the questions for which anyone in your group answers &quot;yes&quot;. Since your group is just you, this doesn't take very long.

However, the person sitting next to you seems to be experiencing a language barrier and asks if you can help. For each of the people in their group, you write down the questions for which they answer &quot;yes&quot;, one per line. For example:&quot;" class="wp-image-128" /><figcaption>Apparently the North Pole is doing a bad job with multilingual support. Also, what kind of customs form depends on other people's answers? <br>PA: "Remember to report any suspicious activity, and collaborate with your seatmates to determine if you are illegal aliens. God Bless America."</figcaption></figure>

<p>This challenge was pretty easy; adding up the length of the union (part 1) and the intersection (part 2) of the various sets of records. I took a minute to refresh my mind on the python set and it's methods, but after that I was pretty much limited by my reading and typing speed. I think this is the first challenge where my typing speed was actually a significant factor. Looking at the leaderboard, the average speed (of the top 100) for this challenge was about 2 minutes. I think I could probably get up there if I did leetcode or hackerrank obsessively. I'll probably never invest the effort for that, though.  </p>



<p>This is the entire <a href="https://github.com/natedileas/advent-of-code">code </a>for this challenge. I could have had less code duplication (and gotten the second part done faster) if I had used an explicit union in part 1. Then, part 2 would have a been a copy-paste and a change of a single function name. If only I had realized that the "any" specification was likely to change to "all" for part 2.</p>

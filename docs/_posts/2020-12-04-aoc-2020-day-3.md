<p>Well, it's day 3. I'm trying not to hit (more than the minimum amount of) trees with my toboggan. I did this challenge during the day, and I did a little better: 18:27 (I'm adding a couple minutes because I started the timer after I read the problem by accident). I wonder how much of the time difference is just being a little less tired? Hard to say. I wish I had the energy to stay up and work on the problems at midnight, but I think that would just lead to me being frustrated and burnt out on the whole thing.</p>

It reads: &quot;Due to the local geology, trees in this area only grow on exact integer coordiantes in a grid. You make a map (your puzzle input) of the open quares (.) and trees (#) you can see. For example: &quot;" class="wp-image-102" /><figcaption>My God, it's full of stees! I mean, trars!</figcaption></figure>



<p>I could have done much better; I lost about 5 minutes to a bug I introduced when I refactored for the second part of the puzzle. I forgot that <code>str.splitlines()</code> removes the line separators, and <code>file.readlines()</code> doesn't, which caused my regressions to fail. It took me a bit to figure out why, but I got it eventually, after holding down ctrl-z and ctrl-y for a bit. Maybe I should have jumped straight to pdb? But that cost me a ton of time on the last puzzle. Pre-emptively, I could've not changed from <code>file.read()</code> and a later <code>data.splitlines()</code>, but I thought there was no difference at the time. Moral: Do Not Change The Working Code Lest Ye Be Damned? Print Out Some Intermediate Data And Maybe You'll Calm Down?</p>



<p>The puzzles are still simple enough that there's not a lot of design choices to explain. Basically, the whole problem reduces to, "Find the number of hashes on a given integer slope in the map." The only wrinkle is that the map is infinitely repeating on the positive x axis, leading to the modulo on line 8 of the function. Initially, I wrote this as a script, then refactored it into a function when the second part of the puzzle required running multiple slopes on the same map, then finding the product.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code">def check_slope(slope, lines):
    nlines = len(lines)
    lenlines = len(lines[0])

    y = 0
    x = 0
    ntrees = 0
    while y &lt; len(lines) - 1:
        x = (x + slope[0]) % lenlines
        y += slope[1]
        ntrees += int(lines[y][x] == '#')

    return ntrees</pre>



<p>This is all pretty idiomatic python, I probably could have named things a bit better though. I write stuff like this all the time when doing image processing, so I didn't mess up the indices, incrementing by the slope properly, or anything silly like that this time.</p>

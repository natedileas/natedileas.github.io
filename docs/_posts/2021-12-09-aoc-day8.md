I had a lot of fun with this one. I'd classify it as "logic puzzle". The problem:

There are many 7-segment displays that are malfunctioning; the inputs have been randomly assigned to the outputs. Our task was to figure out the mapping. Below is an example of the input for a single display; to the left of the pipe are the input patterns for the 10 unique digits. To the right are the numbers we have to decode. 

```
Example test input:

acedgfb cdfbe gcdfa fbcad dab cefabd cdfgeb eafb cagedb ab | cdfeb fcadb cdfeb cdbaf


Output digit mapping:

  0:      1:      2:      3:      4:
 aaaa    ....    aaaa    aaaa    ....
b    c  .    c  .    c  .    c  b    c
b    c  .    c  .    c  .    c  b    c
 ....    ....    dddd    dddd    dddd
e    f  .    f  e    .  .    f  .    f
e    f  .    f  e    .  .    f  .    f
 gggg    ....    gggg    gggg    ....

  5:      6:      7:      8:      9:
 aaaa    aaaa    aaaa    aaaa    aaaa
b    .  b    .  .    c  b    c  b    c
b    .  b    .  .    c  b    c  b    c
 dddd    dddd    ....    dddd    dddd
.    f  e    f  .    f  e    f  .    f
.    f  e    f  .    f  e    f  .    f
 gggg    gggg    ....    gggg    gggg


```

There's some features of the input that make this possible to solve. One, some output digits have a unique length (1,4,7, and 8). This is part one of the problem; simply count the number of 1s,4s,7s, and 8s in the output section. Part two is to decode and sum all the output numbers. Part one holds a clue to part two; there's more usable information to be found by looking at the output patterns. I decided to treat this as a logic puzzle, and wrote {% include sidenote.html id="scribble" text="'Wrote' in this case means illegibly scribbling slightly similar tables 3 times before I got anything useful out of it. " %} down the table below. 

|     | a   | b   | c   | d   | e   | f   | g   | Sum |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 0   | x   | x   | x   |     | x   | x   | x   | 6   |
| 1   |     |     | x   |     |     | x   |     | 2   |
| 2   | x   |     | x   | x   | x   |     | x   | 5   |
| 3   | x   |     | x   | x   |     | x   | x   | 5   |
| 4   |     | x   |     | x   |     | x   |     | 4   |
| 5   | x   | x   |     | x   |     | x   | x   | 5   |
| 6   | x   | x   |     | x   | x   | x   | x   | 6   |
| 7   | x   |     | x   |     |     | x   |     | 3   |
| 8   | x   | x   | x   | x   | x   | x   | x   | 7   |
| 9   | x   | x   | x   | x   |     | x   | x   | 6   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sum | 8   | 6   | 8   | 7   | 4   | 9   | 7   |     |

The sum across the X direction shows the unique info hand-fed to us in part 1. The sum in the Y direction is new info; the characters that map to b, e, and f occur 6, 4, and 9 times in the input, respectively. Now, all we need is a way of telling apart a and c, and d and g. We know from looking at the output mapping that a is in seven and not in one. We also know that g is in eight, but not in four. Since we know which input strings are one, seven, eight, and one, we have all the information we need to make a full mapping table from input to output characters.

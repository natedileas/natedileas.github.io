I'm tired. I did day 2's challenges in just shy of half an hour after work today. I probably could have finished in about a third of that time if I had just noticed an off by one error in the second part. The puzzle even warned me about it! Oh well. 



Side note: why do I make myself sad on purpose? I had resolved to not look at the global leaderboard, because it just makes me sad. Some people spend a lot of time on competitive programming, and I don't begrudge them their hobbies, but the average time for the top 10 for today was about 2'30". What the hell.  



Here's a link to the code on [github](https://github.com/natedileas/advent-of-code/blob/main/2020/day2.py).

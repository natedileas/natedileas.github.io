<p>I'm tired. I did day 2's challenges in just shy of half an hour after work today. I probably could have finished in about a third of that time if I had just noticed an off by one error in the second part. The puzzle even warned me about it! Oh well. </p>



<p>Side note: why do I make myself sad on purpose? I had resolved to not look at the global leaderboard, because it just makes me sad. Some people spend a lot of time on competitive programming, and I don't begrudge them their hobbies, but the average time for the top 10 for today was about 2'30". What the hell.  </p>

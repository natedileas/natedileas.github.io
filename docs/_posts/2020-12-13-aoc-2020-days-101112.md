I had a rough time day 10. I still haven't finished part 2. Days 11 and 12 were fun, but being tired greatly increased the time necessary to complete them.

Day 11 was  a fun modeling task, sort of reminiscent of Conway's Game of Life. Day 12 was a common enough task of movement directions. On both of the tasks, I made a small error in typing, and took a long time to find it in part 2. [Here's the code](https://github.com/natedileas/advent-of-code/tree/main/2020).

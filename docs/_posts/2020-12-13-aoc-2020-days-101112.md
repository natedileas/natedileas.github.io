<p>I had a rough time day 10. I still haven't finished part 2. Days 11 and 12 were fun, but being tired greatly increased the time necessary to complete them.</p>

<p>Day 11 was  a fun modeling task, sort of reminiscent of Conway's Game of Life. Day 12 was a common enough task of movement directions.

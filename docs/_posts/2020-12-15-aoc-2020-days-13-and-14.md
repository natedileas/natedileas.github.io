<p>Blargh. I haven't finished part 2 of day 13 yet, but day 14 was fun. It was a bit hacking exercise, which is always a fun way to exercise my brain. I cheated a little bit by using stackoverflow, but just to remind myself of the right way to set and clear a bit. I wouldn't be surprised if this turned out to be reused later; it had that sort of feel to it.</p>

The ordering of the puzzles is really bothering me.</figcaption></figure>

But the challenges are getting slightly longer, and I'm getting very ready for a real vacation.</figcaption></figure>

Blargh. I haven't finished part 2 of day 13 yet, but day 14 was fun. It was a bit hacking exercise, which is always a fun way to exercise my brain. I cheated a little bit by using stackoverflow, but just to remind myself of the right way to set and clear a bit. I wouldn't be surprised if this turned out to be reused later; it had that sort of feel to it.

I don't have anything pithy to add today, so here's a nice visualization of the ascii art on the puzzle page. The ordering of the puzzles is really bothering me.

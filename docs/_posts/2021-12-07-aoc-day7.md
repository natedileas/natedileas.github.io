<div class="aoc">
<p>The crab submarines all need to be aligned before they'll have enough power to blast a large enough hole for your submarine to get through. However, it doesn't look like they'll be aligned before the whale catches you! Maybe you can help?</p>

Times for today: about 5 minutes. This one was easy; I just had to good the closed-form solution to [triangle numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_number) for part 2. The naive solution would probably have worked just fine though. Generators are the best; they're one of my favorite python tools, but I almost never use them in production code. They're perfect for stuff like this though.


[Code](https://github.com/natedileas/advent-of-code/blob/main/2021/6/template.py)

```python

def find_min_fuel(crabs):
    return min(sum(abs(c-i) for c in crabs) for i in range(max(crabs)))


def find_min_fuelv2(crabs):
    return min(sum((abs(c-i)*(abs(c-i) + 1)) / 2 for c in crabs) for i in range(max(crabs)))


```

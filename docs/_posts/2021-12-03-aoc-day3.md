<p>The submarine has been making some <span title="Turns out oceans are heavy.">odd creaking noises</span>, so you ask it to produce a diagnostic report just in case.</p>

Times for today: 8:38, 29:57. I wasn't rushing, I spent some time reading in the middle. My code was embarrassing, so I'm not going to post it here. Suffice it to say, it was a transpose text and count stuff kind of problem. Tomorrow I want to try screen recording myself, since it's the weekend and I'll have more time.

I made a little visualization of the submarines progress so far. I didn't mean to give myself vertigo, but here we are. I had to mess with units and stuff to get this to look nice; either the scale is tiny or santa has discovered an ocean trench multiple times deeper than marianna.

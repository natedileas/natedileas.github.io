<p><a href="https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/7">Graph theory to the rescue</a>! I've been reviewing some of the puzzles that I didn't finish last year, and one of them dovetailed perfectly with this challenge, allowing me to complete it in a very reasonable amount of time (for me, at least). I think from these pair of challenges, I've learned a lot about practical graph stuff.</p>

It reads &quot;You land at the regional airport in time for your next flight. In fact, it looks like you'll even have time to grab some food: all flights are currently delayed due to issues in luggage processing.

Due to recent aviation regulations, many rules (your puzzle input) are being enforced about bags and their contents; bags must be color-coded and must contain specific quantities of other color-coded bags. Apparently, nobody responsible for these regulations considered how long they would take to enforce!&quot;" class="wp-image-140" /><figcaption>Even in my dreams, I can't win.</figcaption></figure>



<p>It took a long time to get the graph parsed.</p>

<p>Both the challenges boiled down to graph processing. Starting with a set of nodes / edges, I had to load them into a graph, then walk the graph and measure things for different challenges. Here's the <a href="https://github.com/natedileas/advent-of-code/blob/main/2020/day7.py">code</a>! I'll probably go back later and touch it up, renaming things and gleaning critical insights that every other coder learned in CS 203 ("Algorithms, Data Structures, and Deodorant; Optional?"). All joking aside, most CS students I knew were well groomed but slightly less well adjusted.</p>

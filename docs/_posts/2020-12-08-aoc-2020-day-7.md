[Graph theory to the rescue](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/7)! I've been reviewing some of the puzzles that I didn't finish last year, and one of them dovetailed perfectly with this challenge, allowing me to complete it in a very reasonable amount of time (for me, at least). I think from these pair of challenges, I've learned a lot about practical graph stuff.

It took a long time to get the graph parsed.

Both the challenges boiled down to graph processing. Starting with a set of nodes / edges, I had to load them into a graph, then walk the graph and measure things for different challenges. Here's the [code](https://github.com/natedileas/advent-of-code/blob/main/2020/day7.py)! I'll probably go back later and touch it up, renaming things and gleaning critical insights that every other coder learned in CS 203 ("Algorithms, Data Structures, and Deodorant; Optional?"). All joking aside, most CS students I knew were well groomed but slightly less well adjusted.
